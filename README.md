## About

This project began on May 29, 2021. The goal of this project is to create a mock business landing page that encompass elements such as the header, navigation links, and a form. Responsiveness was not a requirement, but it was added since the project owner wanted the user to have flexibility.

## Challenges

- Using VoiceOver for accessibility purposes

  - Cannot tab index inside of FireFox for some reason!

- Due to the sticker header, I really struggled with getting the links to jump to certain sections of the page because the document flow was off. To compromise, I made span tags that you cannot see.

### Tools

- HTML
- CSS with the use of Grid and Flexbox
- Git, Github
- Canva
- Google Fonts
- [Glassmorphism] (https://glassmorphism.com/)
